A simple Python simulation that allows students to explore (simplified) population genetics.

Through this experience, we hope to offer students a few insights:
- Experience how technology and simulations impact the "real world" of scientific inquiry and study
- Gain some minor exposure to computer science, computational thinking, and a programming language (Python, in this case)
- Develop some understanding of how programmers must structure a problem so that it can be tackled by a computer, including potential limitations, seqeuncing of instructions, and common programming elements that help represent "real world" concepts digitally.
